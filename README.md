**HR Attrition Analysis | Tableau Dashboard**

**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition to understand the main factors influencing workforce turnover. The analysis integrates multiple HR dimensions including demographics, compensation, experience, engagement, and organizational structure to provide actionable insights for HR strategy and talent retention.

The dashboard was built using Tableau to deliver an interactive and executive-friendly visualization of attrition trends and workforce patterns.

**Business Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to identify the key drivers of employee attrition and support HR leaders in designing data-driven retention strategies. By analyzing attrition across departments, job roles, career stages, and satisfaction levels, the organization can reduce turnover costs and improve workforce stability.

**Key KPIs Tracked**

Total Employees

Attrition Count

Attrition Rate

Average Monthly Income

Attrition by Department

Attrition by Job Role

Attrition by Satisfaction & Engagement Factors

Attrition by Demographics & Experience

**Dashboard Structure**
1. Executive Overview

Provides a high-level summary of workforce metrics including total employees, attrition rate, and key breakdowns by department, job role, gender, and overtime.

2. Compensation & Promotion Analysis

Analyzes the relationship between attrition and:

Monthly Income

Job Level

Salary Hike Percentage

Years Since Last Promotion

3. Demographics & Experience

Examines how workforce characteristics impact attrition, including:

Age Groups

**Key Insights**

Attrition rate (16.12%) is above the ideal HR benchmark, indicating a retention risk.

Research & Development and technical roles show higher turnover.

Early-career and lower job-level employees are the most vulnerable to attrition.

Low job satisfaction, poor work-life balance, and weak work environment strongly correlate with higher attrition.

Overtime does not show a significant impact compared to engagement and career-related factors.

Highest attrition by education field is observed in HR, followed by Technical Degree and Marketing.
